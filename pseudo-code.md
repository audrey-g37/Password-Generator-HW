## Steps a user takes will have numbers.

## What we want to happen visually for the user will be below the step, indented.

### 1) Clicks the 'generate password' button.

    Message appears to user stating the required criteria/decisions to be made. The message also lets the user know that, once the criteria has been met, a password will generate and will be displayed to the screen. If they are not in a secure location, they should re-visit this site when they can have the new password displayed on their screen.

### 2) Clicks to confirm they want to continue.

    Message appears asking for the length of the password, stating the user must input a value between 8 and 128, inclusive.

### 3) Types a password length using a number greater than or equal to 8, but less than or equal to 128.

    Message appears validating the number was acceptable, and re-states the choice for the user.

### 4) Clicks to confirm the computer correctly stated their number.

    Message appears asking for the character types the user is wanting to include in the password. The options shown include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters. The user must select at least one, but could choose up to all four.

### 5) Types which character-types to include.

### 6) Clicks to confirm the computer correctly stated their choice(s).
